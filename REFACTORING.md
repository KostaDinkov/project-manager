# Code Structure Refactoring

## Overview
The codebase has been refactored to improve maintainability and reduce file sizes by splitting large files into focused, single-responsibility modules.

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHubService Refactoring (791 lines → ~150 lines)

**Old Structure:**
- Single large `github.ts` file with all GitHub operations

**New Structure:**
```
src/services/
├── githubService.ts              # Main service (150 lines)
└── github/
    ├── index.ts                  # Re-exports for compatibility
    ├── types.ts                  # GitHub API types
    ├── issueOperations.ts        # Issue CRUD operations
    ├── branchOperations.ts       # Branch management
    ├── subIssueOperations.ts     # Sub-issue handling
    ├── cacheManager.ts           # Deleted issues cache management
    ├── issueStateManager.ts      # Issue state calculation logic
    └── issueHierarchyBuilder.ts  # Hierarchy building logic
```

### 2. ProjectSpecification Refactoring (458 lines → ~250 lines)

**Extracted Utilities:**
```
src/utils/
├── index.ts                      # Utility exports
├── issueUtils.ts                 # Issue tree manipulation functions
├── branchOperationHandler.ts     # Branch workflow management
└── optimisticUpdateManager.ts    # Optimistic UI updates
```

**Benefits:**
- Separated business logic from UI components
- Reusable utility functions
- Improved testability
- Cleaner component code

### 3. File Size Reduction

| File | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| GitHubService | 791 lines | 150 lines | 81% |
| ProjectSpecification | 458 lines | 250 lines | 45% |

## Module Responsibilities

### GitHub Service Modules

1. **IssueOperations**: Basic CRUD operations for GitHub issues
2. **BranchOperations**: Branch creation, deletion, and merging
3. **SubIssueOperations**: GitHub's native sub-issue API handling
4. **CacheManager**: Deleted issues cache consistency management
5. **IssueStateManager**: Automatic state calculation for parent issues
6. **IssueHierarchyBuilder**: Building issue hierarchies from GitHub data

### Utility Modules

1. **IssueUtils**: Pure functions for issue tree manipulation
2. **BranchOperationHandler**: Coordinates branch operations with error handling
3. **OptimisticUpdateManager**: Manages optimistic UI updates and rollbacks

## Backwards Compatibility

- All existing imports continue to work
- Main GitHubService interface unchanged
- Component interfaces preserved

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Individual modules can be unit tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Utility functions can be reused across components
4. **Performance**: Potential for better tree-shaking and bundle optimization
5. **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Main service usage (unchanged)
import { GitHubService } from '../services/githubService';

// Direct utility usage
import { findIssueInTree, updateIssueInTree } from '../utils/issueUtils';
import { OptimisticUpdateManager } from '../utils/optimisticUpdateManager';

// Advanced usage with individual modules
import { GitHubIssueOperations } from '../services/github/issueOperations';
```
